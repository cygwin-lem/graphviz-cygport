ldesc: "The Graphviz layout programs take descriptions of graphs in a
simple text language, and make diagrams in several useful formats such
as images and SVG for web pages, Postscript for inclusion in PDF or
other documents; or display in an interactive graph browser. (Graphviz
also supports GXL, an XML dialect.)"
